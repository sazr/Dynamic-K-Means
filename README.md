# Dynamic K-Means Algorithm

### Where's the code?

Please reach out to me directly to obtain the code, my contact details can be found in my resume. The repository was publicly accessible, and an individual has incorporated my algorithm into their computer vision thesis without appropriate attribution to me.

### How's it work?

The benefit of this algorithm opposed to normal K-Means is we don't need to 
specify X number of clusters to find.

### Applications:

- Find the dominant colour's in an image.
